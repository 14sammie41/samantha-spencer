          <p>
            In my younger years, I did (like most) a fair bit of bouncing
            between jobs. Starting in a local restaurant gave me a passion for
            customer service, finding out that good service made people happy
            (and pay tips) was such a big motivator. Naturally i grew out of my
            local restaurant and wanted to try something new, so i started
            looking around and found fundraising. It felt logical to move into
            something which gave me the ability to give back whilst talking to
            people. I grew out of this as the life style was pretty hectic and i
            was looking to slow down a bit. From there I came back home and back
            to what i knew, hospitality. Working in a bar was excellent fun and
            allowed me to setlle back in to a more stable home life. When
            looking for a more stable income i went down the road and found our
            local high street convenience store was looking. That was the
            beginning of eight years of retail obsession. When I broke my foot
            in 2024 I had to take some time out of retail to heal and re found
            my love for computers. This lead me to finding my first work from
            home job and then to taking on a Diploma in Web Application
            Development.
