# Samantha Spencer

This page is all about me, where i've come from, what i've done and how i can be the best candidate for your next project. The page will be split into three sub pages containing a 'Home' with my basic about information, a career page setting out what i have done up to this point and a facts page with all of my credentials, contact information and more quirky bits about me.

## User interactions

I would like for all of these pages to link into one another as seamlessly as possible by utilising a nav bar to move from page to page and a footer to link to my socials and GitHub accounts. As this page is all about me most of the information will be interchangeable so I will ensure to add buttons to access other areas of the page for speed of navigation.

## Wireframes of all three pages of the site:

I have sketched up all three pages in mobile, tablet and monitor sizes so that there is a baseline to work from. The bulk of the text will come from my actual CV, so there will be no risk of plaguerism. I intend on using mostly AI created images alongside some images of myself.

## How to:

### Dependancies

This will be for dependancies as i go through this project - complete as they come through.
-Bootstrap.com has been used throughout the project to add items like a navbar, a carousel and a footer. The main reason for this is to mitigate the need for written Javascript to create a responsive site.
-Microsoft Create was used to create AI images to utilize for the Home page and some content in other areas.
-IMGonline.com was used to pull the key colours out of the gaming.jpeg file. These colours were used to create the Root colours.
-Google Fonts used to import two font styles into the style.css file. Both fonts were attributed to the Root in CSS making the styles uniform accross the site.

### Installing

This will be the basics of how to run and use the site as a user and developer - add to closer to the end of the project

### Executing program

Break down in bullet point commands how to execute the program as a developer - add at the end of the project

## Bug problems and solutions

Add each bug as it occurs and the solution for it.
Ensure to credit any solutions found through other developers or sites.

## Source for images and text

Add all images with their alt and source in here.
Don't forget to compress images where possible for best performance accross different platforms.

## Deployment process

Step-by-step guide to deploying the project if it was to be cloned

## Testing

This section should be large so if it is too large add a new read only file and use that for this task and then link into this page for ease of use.
