          <p>
            As a passionate customer services and sales worker, I am pleased to
            be able to apply for this position, to which I hope to bring
            experience and enthusiasm. Over the years I have been involved in
            many community projects both locally and abroad. I pride myself on
            being able to engage a team of people to work as one. My time in
            retail has taught me about managing people at all levels. As a full
            time manager I demonstrated considerable flexibility, prioritizing
            the business at all times. As a member of this team I learnt how to
            cope in a high pressure retail atmosphere. Fundraising taught me the
            importance of giving back to both the community and the world in as
            many ways as I can. My ambition to progress in everything I do means
            that I set myself high standards. I am very confident when working
            with people and have shown my ability to teach and train on many
            occasions. The variety of things I have done and situations I have
            been in not only in retail but also in restaurant, Fundraising and
            office work means I have a very broad outlook on any career I’m in.
            I’m very happy and willing to learn to gain new skills and reach the
            best of my ability in everything I do.
